# kernel-regression-thesis
Code for my Master's thesis including code to classify new observations from a previously built MixGHD clustering model, data cleaning and feature selection, model selection with random forest, RBF SVM, and kernel regression, and a hand-written bootstrapping function to estimate the kernel regression estimates' standard errors.
